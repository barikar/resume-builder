# resume-builder
A mini project built using Streamlit that enables users to create professional resumes and portfolios dynamically. This web app leverages OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3.5 API to auto-generate personalized content and produces a stylized PDF resume using `pdfkit` and HTML/CSS templates.

Project Description: This project is an AI-powered Resume and Portfolio Builder developed as part of Assignment-4. It allows users to fill out their personal, educational, and professional details through a user-friendly form interface. Users can also generate an "About Me" section using GPT-3.5 by simply entering their job title.

Once the form is filled, the app:

* Dynamically creates an HTML resume using user input.
